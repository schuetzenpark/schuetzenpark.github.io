Schuetzen Park has been the site of private special events for more than 150 years. Weddings, anniversaries, family reunions, company picnics, card clubs, organizational meetings and more, have all taken place in the beautiful natural and historical surroundings of the Park. Whether you self-cater, or have us prepare a wonderful home cooked meal or a simple dessert presentation, you will be delighted with the Park√≠s rustic appeal. We can serve up to 36 in the Jens Lorenzen Pavillion, or 100+ under the big tent. We can also provide seating and tents for your outdoor event at the Park at a small cost. References available upon request. Please contact us using the phone numbers or e-mail address below.


**Note**: (Unfortunately, at this time we do not have the ability to serve, or allow the serving of alcoholic beverages in the Park.)
