The Schuetzenpark Stiftung is an endowment of funds set aside to ensure the future of Schuetzen Park. 
These funds are managed by the Quad Cities Community Foundation and will only be accessed 
in times of great need. The Schuetzenpark Gilde contributes 5% of all general donations recieved 
throughout the year to this fund,  and it also places 100% of all funds designated for the Stiftung 
into the endowment. At some future point, revenue generated from this fund could be used for projects 
within the Park, however, at this point, any revenue generated is being reinvested into the Stiftung. 
    If you wish to contribute to the endowment in any form, you may do so <a href="https://qccf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create?funit_id=2229">online</a> or by contacting us through the "<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>"
