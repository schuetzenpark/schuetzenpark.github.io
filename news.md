<h2>Jens Lorenzen Pavilion Transformation</h2>

<p>
The Jens Lorenzen Pavilion underwent a major transformation in 2021 including the installation of removable wall panels which make the building usable year-round. The concrete floor has been polished, a wood-burning stove installed and beer-garden tables from Germany have arrived to provide seating for all types of occasions. The Ash wood paneling used to finish the interior walls, as well as the Cherry door and window trim, was all milled from storm damaged trees from within the Schuetzen Park. Special thanks to the major contributors who gave to make this improvement possible, Riverboat Development Authority, Scott County Regional Authority, The Waste Commission of Scott County and The Schuetzenpark Gilde through the generosity of numerous individual donors.

<h2>Street Car Pavilion Shines!</h2>
    
<p>The historic street car pavilion at Schuetzen Park is once again adorned with colored lights. The lighting replicates those once found on the structure that was built in 1911 with a bequest from Davenport Brewer Heinrich Koehler.</p>

<p>The project was approved by the Davenport Preservation Commission and implemented by volunteers &amp;  members of IBEW local 145. Financial sponsors for the project included the Scott County Historic Preservation Society, Quad-City Questors and individual donors.</p>

<p>The pavilion, which was listed as one of the top 10 most engendered historic structures in Iowa in 2011, is slowly making a "full recovery". Funds have been requested to apply a fresh coat of paint in the spring of 2017 and the ceiling will be restored in late 2017 or early 2018.</p>

Beginning on May, 1, a weekly Stammtisch will take place at Schuetzen Park. A Stammtisch is a gathering of people to discuss a topic of mutual interest. From 1:00 - 3:00PM each Sunday, German speakers of all levels can join in on the fun of learning more about "die deutsche Sprache".  There will always be something good to eat and drink served from the kitchen of the Jens Lorenzen Pavilion and there will  games, discussions of current events, sports, travel and even hikes in the woods - all "auf Deutsch". Participants will be able to take German language magazines home for free as well. The Stammtisch will be held each Sunday in May, June and July... even on holidays.

The Jen Lorenzen Pavillion at the Schuetzen Park will soon have beautiful Hops vines growing on a 
new pergola recently constructed there. The pergola, while acting as a trellis for the hops, will 
also provide shade for the new brick patio underneath, which was installed last fall. Thanks to the 
Moline Foundation and the Mary Iva Gittens Knouse Charitable trust for the funds to make these improvements.

St. Hubertus is the patron saint of hunters. The stag emblem of St. Hubertus is the central theme of 
the new mural on the Jen Lorenzen Pavilion at Schuetzen Park. Designed and painted by Davenport artist 
Sarah Robb, the mural also includes on the left the Davenport Turngemeinde logo, and on the right the 
Schuetzenverein logo. The mural was funded by the City of Davenport Neighborhood Beautification fund 
and private donations. In the spring of 2014, a pergola will be added to the front of the pavilion as well on which hops vines will grow.

<h2>Phase II of Streetcar Pavilion Kicks-Off</h2>
<a href="/assets/images/pavilionRepair.jpg" rel="example_group">
  <img src="/assets/images/pavilionRepairSm.jpg">
</a>
<p>
Fund raising for the second phase of the restoration of the historic streetcar pavilion at Schuetzen Park began in 
February with an initial gift of $1,000 from the Roy E Murray Trust. Phase II consists of the renovation of the 
pavilion's ceiling and beams.
</p>


<p>
Original reinforcement rods in the ceiling have corroded and have caused the 
concrete to crack and fall off.  These areas will be cleaned, coated with 
new concrete, sealed, and painted.
</p>

<div>
<p>
Thanks to gifts from the Riverboat Development Authority and the Roy E Murray Charitable trust, 
phase two of the restoration will begin this summer. Critical repairs to the pavilion's roof supporting 
beams will be completed as will some cosmetic improvements to the exterior of the structure. Donations 
for this ongoing project are still gladly being accepted. 
Anyone wishing to contribute to this project may 
make a donation on the "<a href="support.html">Support</a>" page of this website.

</a>
<p>
A restroom/storage building was constructed this summer by the Carpenter Training Center of the Quad Cities. The building houses a composting toilette which requires no water and very little maintenance. The project was funded by the Riverboat Development Authority and the Waste Commission of Scott County. Volunteers from the Training Center and the Schuetzenpark Gilde contributed many hours to the completion of the shed.

<h2>Schuetzen Park Goes Solar!</h2>

The term "green" is often misused and misrepresented, however, this is truly not the case at Schuetzen Park. All the Park's electric energy needs are now being met by a recently installed solar energy system. Students from Eastern Iowa Community College's (EICCD) Renewable Energy Program recently installed the system at the Park. Grants from the Doris and Victor Day Foundation, The Waste Commission of Scott County and donated materials from EICDD made this project possible.

<p>
November, 2011: The roof of the pavilion was recently replaced, thus completing the most important stage of the building's restoration. Bi-State Masonry completed the removal of the old decayed roof material and installed a new layer of concrete on the roof as well as a protective coating to seal the roof. However, there is still much to be done on the building, but these projects will have to wait until sufficient funds are in hand. A list of the donors for this initial stage of the project will be added to this update in the near future.

<p>
For the 15th consecutive year, the Schuetzen Park Historic Site has conducted it's annual tree 
planting. Students from Davenport West High School Ecology Club and Western Illinois University 
joined volunteers from the Schuetzenpark Gilde to plant 30 Chestnut trees on April 9th near 
the Park's "Hasenheide". A second round of tree planting will occur later in the month and 
will include oak, sycamore, catalpa, hemlock, birch and crab apple trees. The project is 
underwritten by the Trees for Teens Grant Program which is funded by the Iowa Dept. of 
Natural Resources Forestry Bureau, MidAmerican Energy, Black Hills Energy, Alliant Energy, 
Iowa Bankers Association, Trees Forvever, Iowa Tree Farm Committee, and the Iowa Woodland 
Owners Association. Individual donors to the Schuetzen Park also helped fund this project. 
Individuals wishing to donate toward this tree project, or sponsor a tree in the park, may 
still do so by sending a tax deductible donation to the address on the "<a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>" or 
through our on-line donation process on the "<a href="support.html">Support Page</a>".
