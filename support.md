![A Mark or a Yen, a Buck or a Pound, your donation helps maintain Schuetzen Park year round.](/assets/images/donate.jpg)

The preservation of Schuetzen Park depends upon the generosity of people like you. Unlike city, state and national parks, taxes do not support activities at this site. To assist in protecting the park's future, the [Schuetzenpark Stiftung](stiftung.html) has been setup for supporters to donate to. 

**Please help us by making a donation "on-line" or by using [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/2435895).**
     
You can also help by:
 * Sending your tax deductible donation to: Schuetzen Park c/o 3401 Schuetzen Lane #224, Davenport, IOWA 52804-4353 U.S.A.
 * Designating Schuetzen Park in your Will - The Schuetzenpark Gilde also has qualified advisors who can help you designate the Park as a beneficiary to your estate. The legacy to leave will help make the world a better place for your children, grandchildren and people you have never met. Please contact the Gilde for more information on this subject.
 * Clicking on the "Get started" link below to name the Park as the recipient of a 5% donation of your Amazon purchase
