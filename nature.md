The German-Americans that created Davenport's Schuetzen Park recognized the natural beauty of west-Davenport from the Park's very beginning in 1868. For two years, the Schuetzenverein laid out their new park by planting trees, shrubs and by building walkways and buildings for their use. For the grand opening of the park in 1870, the Davenport Democrat reported "This magnificent park, containing some twenty-two acres, is interestingly diversified with hill, dale, caves, tortuous ravines, nooks, dells and splendid old trees." Much as it did in 1900, today this 20-acre site has a place of importance in our community, albeit for new reasons. The man-made aspects of the original park are now gone and the Park is almost completely surrounded by the City, the Park now gives us a glimpse into the natural history of the Upland Mississippi woodlands area. Designated as a nature preserve (Naturschutzgebiet), Schuetzen Park is home to many varieties of flora and fauna.

Several rustic nature [trails](trails.html) lead Park visitors through it's diverse landscapes and allow for a variety of activities such as environmental education, wildlife viewing, hiking, picnicking etc. The Park's trail system is open from May 1 - November 30. The winter months are intended to be a "quiet time" for the wildlife that live there. No motorized vehicles or bicycles are allowed in the Park. Hunting, trapping and harassment of wildlife is also strictly prohibited. We request that you stay on marked trails at all times. Activities such as paintball games, mushroom hunting, or the harvesting of plant materials, are not allowed within the boundaries of the Park.

Many projects take place annually to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained in and around the Park. [Tree, bush and wildflower plantings](/assets/images/TreesPark.jpg), erosion control, invasive plant species eradication and forest management are a few of the projects that are ongoing.
